   | Activity 3 | completed |



All the activities of this control system are performed on the microcontroller **Atmega328**.
The operation of the heat control system is coded in embedded c and the working is demonstrated using a simuation software called SimulIDE.


## Simulation Components

#### Atmega8 microcontroller
#### Button Sensor
#### Led Acctuator


## Simulation

The Testing of the heat controller is coded in emebedded C which is coded in **CodeBlocks** and the working of the project is explained on **SimulIDE simulation software**.Below shown two images where in the 1st image shows the status of the simulation when the system is OFF and the second image shows the status of the system when it is ON.
